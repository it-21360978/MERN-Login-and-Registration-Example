# MERN Login and Registration Example

### This is an example project that demonstrates how to implement user authentication and registration using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

## *Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/it-21360978/MERN-Login-and-Registration-Example.git
  
```

## *Features

Create a MongoDB database and define a user schema with necessary fields (e.g. email, password).

Use Express.js to create RESTful APIs for user registration and authentication.

Implement client-side forms using React.js to allow users to input their registration and login information.

Use Node.js to handle user authentication on the server-side by verifying the user's credentials against the ones stored in the database.

Generate a JSON web token (JWT) on successful login and store it in the client-side local storage for subsequent API requests.

Protect routes that require authentication by checking for the presence of a valid JWT in the request header.

Add error handling and validation to ensure secure user authentication and registration.
